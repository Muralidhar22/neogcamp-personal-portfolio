            Podcasts: A means of Knowledge
        </h1>

    </header>
    <p>I decided to write this blog on podcasts that I listen to personally
        .Why about podcasts?
        <br>
        As not everyone is a book worm
        and I think we should not limit taking information through only one form of media and
        <span>Podcasts are something I listen in my free time</span>
        I wouldn't consider myself as a serious podcast listener, but yeah it's something
        I'd prefer to learn or know about different people and things
    </p>

    <p>The following is a curated list of some knowledge Podcasts by me, Hope you find these knowledgable ðŸ“œ or fun ðŸŽ§
